##### Assignment #3 - JavaScript and The Canvas

## Cat Age Calculator

### Part 1 - Cat in Canvas

A cat graphic is shown. I used Canvas to draw the cat and titled it "Cat Age Calculator." The colour of the cat's head will change every 2 seconds.

### Part 2 - Calculation

According to the user's input, the cat's age converts to the human's age as below.

| Life Stage | Age of Cat (in month) | Age in Human Years |

The badge is growing; when the mouse is over the canvas, the speed of growth increases, and when the mouse is out, the speed of growth returns to normal.
